VF2 algorithm is implemented by the class VF2SubgraphIsomorphismInspector in JGraphT.
The process finds a mapping between the two graphs G1 and G2 determines the 
isomorphism mapping M, which associates vertices G1 with vertices of G2 and vice 
versa. It can be described by means of a state space representation which is created 
by the algorithm while exploring the search graph in depth-first fashion.
Each state s of the matching process can be associated with a partial mapping M(s).
At each level, the algorithm computes the set of the vertex pairs that are candidates 
to be added to the current state s.
If a pair of vertices (v, w) is feasible, the mapping is extended and the associated 
successor state s' is computed.
The whole procedure is then repeated for state s'.
