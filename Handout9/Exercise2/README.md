# Programming Lab III - Handout9 - Exercise2
## How to use it <br/>
There is a file called *particlePipeline.sh* which can be executed by typing: <br/>
> *./particlePipeline.sh [input folder or file] [output folder or file]*
Example: *./particlePipeline.sh data output1*

in this case exercise 1&2 will use same input and output folders or files. <br/>
if the user wants to use output folder on exercise1 as an input for exercise2,<br/>
then he has to type third argument:
>> *./particlePipeline.sh [input folder or file] [1st output folder or file] [2nd output folder or file]*
Example: *./particlePipeline.sh data output1 output2*

if he wants to change image(s) format then use it/them on exercise2, the he has to use:
>> *./particlePipeline.sh [input folder or file] [1st output folder or file] [2nd output folder or file] [image(s) format]*
Example: *./particlePipeline.sh data output1 output2 png*
