Handout 6

It is not the right behavior to wait for user input if no command line arguments are passed. 
Also, it is not a good idea to store all tasks in one single application. Who should use it this way? 
Bad naming convention: App.java – what does that mean? -1P
When I simply press enter, I get a lot of exceptions. You should better check the user input. Also I do not have the chance to test one of the exercises alone. For further handouts please split your application according to the exercises. 

Task 1
- Output is not really human-readable.
- The class Documents is not well-structured. How are all these methods related to documents? You have a mixture between private variables and variables which are generated on the fly.
- The following code is wrong:
        if(avg%1==0)
        	System.out.println((int)avg);
        else
        	System.out.println((int)avg+" and "+(int)avg+1);
I assume it is used to print integer years. But the results are somehow wrong (prints only one value) and why do you assume that the average is an integer? -0.5P
- Although it is possible, you should use brackets for your if-else environments:
 	if(avg%1==0)
        	System.out.println((int)avg);
        else
        	System.out.println((int)avg+" and "+(int)avg+1);
3.5/4

Task 2
- It was asked to use “GnpRandomGraphGenerator” - you wrote your own class which inherited from this class. This is nice, but I cannot see any advantage for doing this. 
- I cannot find any explanation for your choice of random variables. -1P
- I am not able to distinguish between strong and weak ties in your screenshot. -0.5P

Task 3
- Example run I did:

GML file can be found in data folder as SocialNetwork.gml
Please enter file name, sorce gene and target gene respectivly:
pleas leave space between them!
FIsInGene.csv AAAS THOC1
AAASTHOC1


I cannot understand what it is supposed to show.

- There does not seem to be any filtering of annotation “activat*”, “catalyz*”, “complex”, and “inhibit*”, -1P.
- There is a function (SimpleDirectedWeightedGraph) to create the required graph but it is not used, -1P.
- The edges seem to be added correctly to the non-used code.
- I was not able to understand how the shortest path is printed, -1P. You will have to present your solution and then get points.
